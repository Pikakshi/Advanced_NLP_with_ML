# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

* Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - **Arthur Samuel, 1959**.
    - Wrote a checkers playing program
    - Program learned by observing board positions

* Study of algorithms that improve their performance P at some task T with experience E - **Tom Mitchell, 1998**.
    - A well-defined learning task is given by <P, T, E>.
    - T: Playing checkers
    - P: The number (or percentage) of games won
    - E: Playing against oneself.

# Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning

- Task driven learning.
- Making predictions using data.
- Consider the *email spam detection* problem -- predicting whether an email is spam or not.

- Given a dataset with *'right answers'*, an algorithm learns to produce predictions on never-before-seen data.

- Examples: spam detection, fraud detection, housing price prediction, sentiment prediction, ..






## 2. Unsupervised Learning

- Data driven learning
- Extracting structure from data
- Consider the problem of *market segmentation*.
    - Given a dataset of characteristics and purchasing behaviour of shoppers 
    - Unsupervised Learning Task: Segment shoppers into groups or clusters exhibiting similar behaviour
    - No right or wrongs about number of clusters that can be found, which shopper belongs to which cluster or how to describe a cluster.

- Given an unlabeled dataset (x$_1$, x$_2$, …, x$_n$) : an algorithm finds hidden structures in the data. 


Examples of Unsupervised Learning:

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

- Learning what to do and how to map **situations** to **actions**. 
- The **agent** is not told which action to take, but instead must discover which action will yield the maximum **reward (goal)**. The end result is to maximize the numerical reward signal. 
- Algorithm learns to react to an **environment**.
- For instance: a toddler learning to walk, self driving cars,..

## Semi-supervised Learning

- Yet another type of learning that practitioners use for real-world machine learning problems since it can be expensive and time-consuming to label all data, and difficult to work with unlabeled data.
- Represent a middle ground between supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. 
- Huge amount of input data and only some of it is labeled.
